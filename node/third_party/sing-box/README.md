# mbox

A reference implementation of [mieru](https://github.com/enfein/mieru) protocol
in sing-box.

We don't guarantee all sing-box features are working. We recommend you maintain
your own fork.

## Example Configuration with mieru Outbound (Proxy Client)

```js
{
    "inbounds": [
        {
            "type": "mixed",
            "tag": "mixed-in",
            "listen": "0.0.0.0",
            "listen_port": 1080
        }
    ],
    "outbounds": [
        {
            "type": "mieru",
            "tag": "mieru-out",
            "server": "127.0.0.1",
            "server_port": 8964,
            "transport": "TCP",
            "username": "baozi",
            "password": "manlianpenfen",
            "traffic_pattern": "GgQIARAK"
        }
    ],
    "route": {
        "rules": [
            {
                "inbound": ["mixed-in"],
                "action": "route",
                "outbound": "mieru-out"
            }
        ]
    },
    "log": {
        "level": "warn"
    }
}
```

You can also use `server_ports` to set a list of port ranges.

## Example Configuration with mieru Inbound (Proxy Server)

```js
{
    "inbounds": [
        {
            "type": "mieru",
            "tag": "mieru-tcp",
            "listen": "0.0.0.0",
            "listen_port": 8964,
            "transport": "TCP",
            "users": [
                {
                    "name": "baozi",
                    "password": "manlianpenfen"
                }
            ],
            "traffic_pattern": "GgQIARAK"
        }
    ],
    "outbounds": [],
    "route": {},
    "log": {
        "level": "warn"
    }
}
```

## Branches

- `mieru` branch has the latest code based on recent upstream releases. It may not be stable.
- `release-*` branches record the references where binaries are published. Those branches don't change after creation.

## Limitations

- UDP outbound can't use domain name as server address.
